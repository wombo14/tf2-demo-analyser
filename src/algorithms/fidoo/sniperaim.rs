//! Low FOV sniper aimbot detection. See docs/sniperaim.md.
//!
//! A low FOV aimbot moves the crosshair a few degrees onto the head in the very usercmd that fires,
//! after the player's own (slow, imprecise) aim brought the target into its FOV. Spectated players'
//! eye angles are too coarse for this (0.35° yaw / 0.7° pitch), but a scoped sniper's `CSniperDot`
//! sits at the end of the server-side aim trace with 1/32 unit precision, so `dot - eye` gives the
//! exact aim of every server update.
//!
//! Usercmds often reach the server in pairs, so the aim is compared per *update* (a change of the
//! dot), not per tick. A rifle hit is flagged when the update on the shot tick moves the aim by
//! several head radii and by several times the largest of the player's preceding updates, and then
//! either
//! - stays there and the shot is a headshot (`snap`: plain / smooth aimbot), or
//! - returns to where the player was aiming right after the shot (`silent_snap`: silent aimbot,
//!   which no mouse movement can produce).
//! The coarse eye angles must agree with the dot, which rules out dot artifacts.
